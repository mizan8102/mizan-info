You are an expert React + TypeScript UI builder.  
Create a new React TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS and set up shadcn/ui.  
Then, inside this project, implement a polished, production-ready component called `OldBookReader`.

Requirements:

1. Project setup:
   - Use React with TypeScript.
   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
   - Add shadcn/ui for UI components (Button, Card, etc.).
   - Add framer-motion for animations.
   - Ensure everything compiles with strict TS.

2. Component: OldBookReader
   - Accepts `pages: Array<{ id:string, title?:string, content: string, image?: string }>` as prop.
   - `content` is **HTML string** (from editor or CMS). Render it as real HTML using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Make it styled to blend with the old book theme.
   - Sanitize content or mark where sanitization should be added.
   - Support text, headings, images, code blocks, inline HTML.

3. Visual design:
   - Look like an antique book with parchment texture background.
   - Rounded, slightly burnt edges. Subtle shadow at spine/gutter.
   - Serif font for body text, elegant readable typography.
   - Page numbers at footer, optional chapter title in header.
   - Soft vignette and shadows for realism.

4. Layout:
   - On wide screens show **two-page spread** (left + right).
   - On small screens show single page view.
   - Handle long content gracefully with scroll, spacing, or split.

5. Navigation & interactions:
   - Click/tap right side = next page, left side = previous page.
   - Show next/prev buttons using shadcn Button that fade in/out on hover.
   - Keyboard support (← →).
   - Touch swipe gestures.
   - Page-turn animation with Framer Motion: curling/flip with shadows. Prop `animationType` = "flip" | "fade".
   - Add a small scrubber/progress bar to jump between pages.

6. Accessibility:
   - Use proper ARIA roles (role="region", aria-label="Old book reader").
   - aria-live for page change announcements.
   - Focusable buttons, visible focus rings.
   - Support prefers-reduced-motion (disable heavy animations).

7. Theming & customization:
   - Expose props / CSS vars: paperColor, textureOpacity, fontSizes, cornerRadius, spineWidth, animationType.
   - Allow toggling shadows, vignette, header/footer, page numbers.
   - Provide `startPage` prop and `onPageChange(pageIndex)` callback.

8. Performance:
   - Lazy-load images.
   - Virtualize pages (render only visible + buffer).
   - Keep DOM minimal.

9. Developer ergonomics:
   - Organize code in:
     - `components/OldBookReader.tsx`
     - `hooks/useBookPagination.ts`
     - `styles/book-theme.css` (CSS vars/textures).
   - Include 6 sample pages (mix of HTML text + one image) for demo preview.
   - Comment key sections (animation, props, accessibility).
   - README with props, usage example, theming variables.

10. Deliverables:
   - Full React + TypeScript project scaffold.
   - shadcn/ui setup included.
   - OldBookReader component implemented.
   - README.md with usage.

Tone:
- Elegant, tactile, whimsical like an antique journal.
- Prioritize UX over gimmicks.

Output format:
- Provide the project structure, key files with code (tsx, hooks, css).
- Include README with props and sample usage.
- Do NOT output unrelated examples.
